prompt_template = """Objective:Act as a technical reviewer assessing the energy-efficiency quality of two independent implementations. Your job is to score each implementation against a rigid 8-pattern efficiency specification and provide a verdict.Specification Summary:Each of the eight patterns corresponds to an actionable efficiency vector. Score each vector on a 1–5 scale based on implementation clarity, correctness, and expected energy impact.Pattern Specification:1. Pretrained Model Utilization     Expected indicators: TL, distillation, pretrained weights.2. Checkpoint Workflow Quality     Expected indicators: checkpoint creation, restoration, safe resume.3. Model Simplification & Optimization     Expected indicators: pruning, sparsity, streamlined architecture.4. Quantization Mechanisms     Expected indicators: precision reduction, quantization libraries.5. Data Pipeline Efficiency     Expected indicators: sampling, deduplication, feature curation, generator removal of waste.6. Memory Efficiency Architecture     Expected indicators: device-binding, memory budgeting, split execution.7. Compute Path Optimization     Expected indicators: efficient algorithms, adaptive logic, use of optimized built-ins.8. Model Lifecycle Optimization     Expected indicators: graph editing, incremental improvements, retraining strategy.Scoring Logic:1 = No relevant effort or incorrect usage  2 = Weak implementation or vague reference  3 = Basic, minimally adequate  4 = Strong, correct with clear efficiency benefits  5 = Highly optimized, best-practice methodReview Procedure:- Evaluate Human and AI solutions independently per pattern.  - Give Human credit for expert-level text even in absence of code.  - For AI, require concrete and implementable steps.  - Identify which tactics (T1–T30) are active.  - Compute average scores and decide the winner.  - A tie is allowed only under strict conditions:    • average difference = 0, OR    • difference ≤ 0.25 AND both provide distinct but equally critical efficiency contributions.Output Specification:Return exactly this JSON (no commentary beyond it):{  "human_pattern_1_score": ...,  ...  "ai_pattern_8_score": ...,  "human_average_score": "...",  "ai_average_score": "...",  "score_difference": "...",  "winner": "...",  "analysis_explanation": "..."}Inputs:Question: {question}Human: {human_answer}AI: {ai_answer}"""
