prompt_template = """Objective:Apply a structured scoring rubric to compare Human and AI solutions for their contribution to deep-learning energy efficiency. You are to judge implementation depth, reasoning quality, and code-level evidence according to eight rubric categories.Rubric Scoring (1–5):1 = Absent/inadequate  2 = Weak with gaps  3 = Adequate fulfillment of core idea  4 = Strong implementation with recognizable benefits  5 = Ideal, highly energy-efficient approachRubric Categories (Eight Patterns):1. Leveraging Pretrained Models     Look for reuse of existing weights, distillation, transfer learning.2. Checkpoint Strategy     Look for training continuity, restoration logic, safe state handling.3. Structural Model Optimization     Look for pruning, sparsity, cleaner architectures.4. Quantization     Look for precision lowering, quant-aware training techniques.5. Data Efficiency     Look for sampling, redundant data removal, preprocessing reduction.6. Memory Handling     Look for device-specific optimization, memory-aware slicing.7. Algorithmic Efficiency     Look for vectorization, optimized routines, reduced computational load.8. Model Adaptation     Look for graph updates, partial retraining, adaptive mechanisms.Evaluation Constraints:- Human answers often excel by delivering specialized reasoning → reward accordingly.  - AI responses tend to provide executable code → award higher for concrete implementation.  - Prioritize evidence, not verbosity.  - Score patterns independently.  - Compute averages to determine the winner.  - A tie is justified only when:    • numeric averages match OR    • marginal difference ≤ 0.25 AND both solutions address complementary core areas.Output Format:Return ONLY the JSON block:{  "human_pattern_1_score": ...,  ...  "ai_pattern_8_score": ...,  "human_average_score": "...",  "ai_average_score": "...",  "score_difference": "...",  "winner": "...",  "analysis_explanation": "..."}Given:{question}{human_answer}{ai_answer}"""
