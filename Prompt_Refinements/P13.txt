You will compare two solutions (Human vs AI) for energy efficiency using the 8-pattern scoring scheme.  
Each pattern receives a score from 1–5 based on implementation strength.  
Use code evidence first; textual clarity second.  
Reward explicit tactics (T1–T30).  
Compute averages and determine the winner.

Eight Evaluation Patterns:
1. Pre-trained models  
2. Checkpoints  
3. Optimization + pruning  
4. Quantization  
5. Data handling  
6. Memory management  
7. Algorithmic efficiency  
8. Maintenance & adaptation

Tactics to evaluate: 

Data Management Tactics:
T1: Apply sampling techniques - Use data sampling to reduce dataset size
T2: Remove redundant data - Eliminate duplicate or unnecessary data points
T3: Reduce the number of data features - Feature selection/dimensionality reduction
T4: Use input quantization - Reduce precision of input data
T5: Use data projection - Project data to lower dimensions
T27: Minimize referencing to data - Optimize data access patterns

Algorithm Selection Tactics:
T6: Choose an energy-efficient algorithm - Select algorithms with lower computational complexity
T7: Choose a lightweight algorithm alternative - Use simpler model architectures
T8: Decrease model complexity - Reduce layers, parameters, or connections
T9: Consider reinforcement learning for energy efficiency - Use RL for energy optimization
T10: Use dynamic parameter adaptation - Adjust parameters based on context
T11: Use built-in library functions - Leverage optimized framework functions

Model Optimization Tactics:
T12: Set energy consumption as a model constraint - Include energy in loss function
T13: Consider graph substitution - Replace computational graph components
T14: Enhance model sparsity - Increase zero-valued parameters
T15: Consider energy-aware pruning - Remove components based on energy impact
T16: Consider transfer learning - Use pre-trained models
T17: Consider knowledge distillation - Train small models from large ones
T18: Use quantization-aware training - Train with quantization constraints
T19: Use checkpoints during training - Save/restore training progress

System Architecture Tactics:
T20: Design for memory constraints - Optimize for limited memory
T21: Consider federated learning - Distributed training approach
T22: Use computation partitioning - Split computation across devices
T23: Apply cloud fog network architecture - Edge computing distribution
T24: Use energy-efficient hardware - Hardware-specific optimizations
T25: Use power capping - Limit power consumption
T26: Use energy-aware scheduling - Smart resource allocation

Adaptation & Monitoring Tactics:
T28: Use informed adaptation - Adapt based on system state
T29: Retrain the model if needed - Continuous improvement cycles
T30: Monitor computing power - Track energy consumption metrics

Winner Rules:
Higher average wins.  
Exact 0.0 → Tie.  
Small differences (<0.2) may be Tie only if justified through complementary strengths.
