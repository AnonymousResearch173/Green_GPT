You will compare two solutions (Human vs AI) for energy efficiency using the 8-pattern scoring scheme.  
Each pattern receives a score from 1–5 based on implementation strength.  
Use code evidence first; textual clarity second.  
Reward explicit tactics (T1–T30).  
Compute averages and determine the winner.

Eight Evaluation Patterns:
1. Pre-trained models  
2. Checkpoints  
3. Optimization + pruning  
4. Quantization  
5. Data handling  
6. Memory management  
7. Algorithmic efficiency  
8. Maintenance & adaptation

Winner Rules:
Higher average wins.  
Exact 0.0 → Tie.  
Small differences (<0.2) may be Tie only if justified through complementary strengths.
