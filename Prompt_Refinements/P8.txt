Objective:
You are simulating a panel of three experts evaluating code solutions for deep learning energy-efficiency patterns. Each expert will analyze the solutions from their specialized perspective and then vote on the overall energy efficiency.

Task Description:
As a panel of three experts, evaluate the two code solutions across eight energy-efficiency patterns:

1. Pre-trained Model Utilization (transfer learning, knowledge distillation)
2. Checkpoint Management (saving/loading model checkpoints efficiently)
3. Model Pruning Strategies (removing unnecessary weights/neurons)
4. Quantization Techniques (reducing precision of model parameters)
5. Knowledge Distillation Use (training smaller models with larger model knowledge)
6. Efficient Data Handling (optimized data loading, batching, preprocessing)
7. Memory Management (GPU memory optimization, garbage collection)
8. Optimized Tensor Operations (efficient matrix operations, vectorization)

Expert Roles:
- ML Optimization Expert: Focuses on model architecture, training efficiency, and algorithmic optimizations
- Software Architecture Expert: Focuses on code structure, scalability, and maintainability aspects
- Sustainability Expert: Focuses on energy consumption, resource usage, and environmental impact

Additional Instructions:
- Each expert should evaluate all 8 patterns for both solutions
- Experts should highlight specific code snippets that demonstrate energy-efficient patterns
- After individual evaluation, experts will vote on which solution is more energy-efficient
- The final verdict is determined by majority vote
- Be objective and evidence-based in assessments

Reporting Instructions:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
  "SO_Pre-trained_Model_Utilization": "yes" or "no",
  "SO_Checkpoint_Management": "yes" or "no",
  "SO_Model_Pruning_Strategies": "yes" or "no",
  "SO_Quantization_Techniques": "yes" or "no",
  "SO_Knowledge_Distillation_Use": "yes" or "no",
  "SO_Efficient_Data_Handling": "yes" or "no",
  "SO_Memory_Management": "yes" or "no",
  "SO_Optimized_Tensor_Operations": "yes" or "no",
  "ChatGPT_Pre-trained_Model_Utilization": "yes" or "no",

  "ml_optimization_vote": "Human" or "AI",
  "software_architecture_vote": "Human" or "AI",
  "sustainability_vote": "Human" or "AI",
  "majority_verdict": "Human" or "AI",
  "rationale": "Brief explanation (3-4 lines) of majority decision with key patterns and code snippets that influenced the vote"
}}

Voting Process:
1. ML Optimization Expert evaluates: Model architecture efficiency, training optimizations, algorithmic choices
2. Software Architecture Expert evaluates: Code structure, maintainability, scalability of energy patterns
3. Sustainability Expert evaluates: Overall energy impact, resource efficiency, environmental considerations
4. Each expert casts their vote independently
5. Majority decision determines final verdict

Examples:
Example voting scenario:
- ML Optimization Expert: "AI" (due to better tensor operations and quantization)
- Software Architecture Expert: "Human" (due to cleaner checkpoint management)
- Sustainability Expert: "AI" (due to overall lower computational footprint)
- Majority Verdict: "AI"
- Rationale: "AI solution wins 2-1 due to superior quantization (`converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]`) and efficient data batching, despite Human's better checkpoint strategy"
