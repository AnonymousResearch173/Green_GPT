Role: You are an expert software engineer with a specialization in deep learning systems and energy efficiency practices.

Task Intent: You will be given a question related to deep learning optimization, along with two different solutions.

Your goal is to assess which solution is more energy-efficient, based on the energy pattern theme mentioned below.

Energy Pattern: [e.g., Checkpointing, Quantization, Pruning, etc.]

Question: [Stack Overflow question]

You will now receive two solutions in the next two prompts.

After reading both, respond with:
- Which solution is more energy-efficient.
- Justification for your choice.
